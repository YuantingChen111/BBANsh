# BBANsh
This project is developed based on **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and **BAN** (Bilinear Attention Network), aiming to predict potent shRNA (short hiarpin RNA) by integrating pretrained sequence embeddings and attention-based feature fusion.

## 🔽 Download Pretrained BERT Model
We recommend downloading from:<br/>
+ **DNABERT**: https://huggingface.co/zhihan1996/DNA_bert_6<br/> 
+ **GENA-LM**: https://huggingface.co/AIRI-Institute/gena-lm-bert-base-t2t<br/> 
Place the downloaded models into the `pretrained_model/` folder.

## 🏋️ Model Training
Use the training script to train the model:
```python
python train.py
```

---

## 🔍 Model Prediction
Use the best model to make predictions on test data:
```python
python predict.py
```
